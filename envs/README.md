# Solanum pangenomics

This is a collection of scripts that were used to build the solanum pangenome.
This work was conducted on a SLURM system - jobs scripts are under the `scripts/` directory.
The `slurm/` directory is used to store the output of slurm scripts to avoid cluttering the main directory.
Every effort was made to avoid manual intermediate analysis but some tasks, such as manual curation of the scaffolded assembly, were unavoidable.

Recipes for conda environments are under the `envs/` directory.
